# loan-prediction-project

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project is a machine learning solution to predict whether a loan will be approved or not, based on customer details. It is part of my data science learning journey using Python.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (train.csv)
- Includes customer features such as income, credit history, marital status, etc.

## âœ… Steps Completed So Far

1. **Understanding the Problem**  
   - Binary classification (predicting 0 or 1: loan approved or not).

2. **Data Loading & Initial Inspection**  
   - Loaded train.csv and explored the basic structure.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values.
   - Dropped columns not useful for prediction.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Gained insights from categorical and numerical variables.

5. **Feature Engineering & Feature Selection**  
   - Transformed categorical values into numeric (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).
   - Standardized numerical features.

6. **Data Splitting**  
   - Split into training and test sets for model evaluation.

##  Next Goals

- Model Building: Train my first model (Logistic Regression), Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score
- Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables (LabelEncoding, OneHotEncoding), Scale numerical data (StandardScaler)
- Train and evaluate more models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- Tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Improve the classification metrics, especially **recall** for Class 0.
- Save the final model and deploy it (optional).
